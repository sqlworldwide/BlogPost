Recently Kevin Kline ([Blog](https://kevinekline.com/)|[Twitter](https://twitter.com/kekline)) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/kekline/status/1370094638057586696) asking about 'your favorite tutorial for someone wanting to get up to speed on github?'.
There were many responses from the community. I thought of creating a list of those responses so others can benefit and at the same time modify the list.
